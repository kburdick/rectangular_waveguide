Electrodynamics Programming Project

-This program calculates the intensity of an electric field in a rectangular waveguide, specifically for the transverse magnetic modes
in less than 50 lines of python code. This was a project in my Electrodynamics (PHYS-470) class in the spring semester of 2019.
